# KiCad Components

This repository contains an inventory of KiCad symbols and footprints that i've created and used for my own projects.

## Connectors

### S36B-WPZK-A

36-pin JST WPZ series header, with the "A" keying. Used on a number of motorcycle ECMs, including the EFI version of the on-road KLX 250/300. The off-road KLX 300 uses a different connector.
- The WPZ series isn't listed in the current JST catalog, but they are still in production and can be ordered from the JST Japan web store: https://order.jst-mfg.com/InternetShop/app/
- JST USA will sell them to you as well, but the minimum order is a full carton and the lead time is long. Lead time from JST Japan was ~10 business days + a few days for shipping
